# Clash Royal Api Frontend

The PRPL pattern, in a nutshell:

* **Push** components required for the initial route
* **Render** initial route ASAP
* **Pre-cache** components for remaining routes
* **Lazy-load** and progressively upgrade next routes on-demand

##### Prerequisites

Install [Polymer CLI](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli) using
[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org)).

    npm install -g polymer-cli@next

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8081` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    npm start

Note, the CR Api is not connected yet.

### Build

The `npm run build` command builds your Polymer application for production, using build configuration options provided by the command line or in your project's `polymer.json` file.

We make 3 builds by default
`polymer build` Will call all 3
```
build/
  es5-bundled/
  es6-bundled/
  esm-bundled/
```

* `es5-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is compiled to ES5 for compatibility with older browsers.
* `es6-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. ES6 code is served as-is. This build is for browsers that can handle ES6 code - see [building your project for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/toolbox/build-for-production#compiling) for a list.
* `esm-bundled` is a bundled, minified build with a service worker. It uses standard ES module import/export statements for browsers that support them.

Run `polymer help build` for the full list of available options and optimizations. Also, see the documentation on the [polymer.json specification](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/docs/tools/polymer-json) and [building your Polymer application for production](https://www.polymer-project.org/3.0/toolbox/build-for-production).


### Run tests

This command will run [Web Component Tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester)
against the browsers currently installed on your machine:

    npm test

If running Windows you will need to set the following environment variables:

- LAUNCHPAD_BROWSERS
- LAUNCHPAD_CHROME
